							<p>Cosmological simulations, from
                <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1983MNRAS.204..891K">Klypin
                & Shandarin (1983)</a> to
                <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2005Natur.435..629S">Springel
                et al. (2005)</a> and beyond, show that the Universe is made of
                thread-like structures, tying together the densest parts of the cosmos.
                Similar features were seen in large redshift surveys, from
                <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1978MNRAS.185..357J">J&ocirc;everr,
                Jaan, & Erik (1978)</a> to <a href="https://www.sdss.org/">the
                Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>. These filaments are an important reservoir
                of baryons in the Universe -- most of the missing baryons should be
                in warm-hot gas in these structures.
             </p>

							<p>If filaments are full of gas, they should be visible to
              X-ray satellites. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1995A&A...302L...9B">Briel
              & Henry (1995)</a> went looking for filaments in the ROSAT All-Sky
              Survey, but found nothing -- and the next decade and a half was full
              of similar non-detections.  It wasn't until the work of
              <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2008A&A...482L..29W">Werner
              et al. (2008)</a> until a compelling detection of filaments between
              clusters was seen, and this was for the special case of two merging
              clusters, where the filament was seen mostly on-axis. Since 2008,
              there have been several more detections of X-ray filaments (e.g.,
              <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015Natur.528..105E">Eckert
                et al., 2008</a>,
                <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...858...44A">Alvarez
                et al., 2018</a>), but, not to take anything away from those works,
              all have utilized the enhanced temperature and density of filaments
              around merging clusters. </p>

							<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images\X-ray_image.png" alt="" /></span>
                In <i>Chandra</i> Cycle 13, 2 Msec was awarded to observe
                Abell 133, a relatively nearby cluster (z = 0.0559) out to
                and slightly beyond the virial radius.
              While this program was intended to study the virilization region,
            upon removing point sources and clumps three large-scale structures
            were visible (seen in the image on the right).
            These were believed to be filaments of the Cosmic Web
          seen in these deep images (<a
          href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013HEAD...1340101V">Vikhlinin
          2013</a>). If true, this would be a significant result, not
          just for the analysis of these filaments, but also for the potential
          for future X-ray satellites to perform similar observations of a large
          number of clusters. But, soon after the announcement of these
          results, another study by <a
          href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014MNRAS.437.1909M">
          Morandi & Cui (2014)</a> on the same data was released, and they did
          not detect the same structures. Obviously, an independent measurement
          was needed to clarify the situation. </p>

          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images\IMACS_coverage_of_xray.png" alt="" /></span>
          This is where we come in. Using the IMACS spectrograph on the Baade Magellan
          telescope, we conducted a spectroscopic survey of over 3,000 galaxies in and
          around the X-ray field of view. This 4 year campaign, in combination with
          archival redshift surveys (<a href="http://www.6dfgs.net/">6DF</a>;
           <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2004AJ....128.1558S">NFPS</a>;
            <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1997astro.ph..9036W">Way,
              Quintana, & Infante, 1997</a>), gave us a catalog of around 300
            spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members. The distribution of these
           galaxies can be seen in the image to the left. As an added bonus of this
           survey, we were able to better constrain the kinematic state of the cluster;
           evidence of an ongoing-merger reported by prior works was not seen under
           deeper scrutiny.</p>

           <p> <span class="image largeright"><img src="images\crosscor_analysis_of_filaments.png" alt="" /></span>
            The comparison between the distribution of the galaxies and the detected X-ray
            structure is shown in the image to the right. On the left, we show the
            cross-correlation between the X-ray emission and the galaxy emission;
            it peaks at 0 degrees -- that is, when rotating the galaxies around a
            fixed center, they show the strongest ties to the X-rays at their observed
            position. The right image is a measure of the angular density for the galaxies;
            this peaks at the positions of the two southern filaments (shown by vertical bars),
            but the northern structure does not exactly align with the observed filament.
            Nevertheless, the significance of the connection between the galaxies and X-rays
            is roughly 5-sigma.</p>

            <p><span class="image largeright"><img src="images\lss_around_a133.png" alt="" /></span>
             One of the assumptions of the analysis so far is that the detected
             filaments connect to the Cosmic Web; if that's true, than we should expect to see
             large scale structure connecting to the cluster at around where the
             X-ray filaments are. Using the large field covered by the 6DF, we
             identified all possible filaments that could be connecting to Abell
             133. These are shown in the figure to the right. Their connection
             points all align with the directions seen in the X-ray image. This
             is further compelling evidence that we are actually seeing evidence
             of cosmic filaments connecting to a cluster.</p>

             <p>This isn't the end of things, of course. I am currently conducting
             a much deeper spectroscopic survey with IMACS, which will tie down
             the area where the cosmic and cluster filaments meet. Using better
             spectroscopic methods than the previous survey, we will be able
             to greatly expand our understanding of the area around Abell 133.
             In addition, I secured time on the <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i>
             to observe a nearby quasar with COS. This will give us an independent
             measure of the density of the gas at one filament sightline. Look
             for these results in the coming year!</p>
