							<p>What is the difference between a galaxy group and a galaxy cluster?
								The simple answer is clusters have more galaxies. But is that it?
								Are groups just scaled-down versions of clusters? Specifcally,
								can we take what we know about clusters, project to lower halo
								masses, and get reasonable answers for the properties of groups?
								Or is there something fundamentally different between the two --
								and, if so, where do we draw a line separating groups and clusters?
							 </p>

							<p>One way to approach this problem is to examine the scaling relations
							between observable properties of groups and clusters -- things like
							their mass, gas temperature, and X-ray luminosity.
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1986MNRAS.222..323K/abstract">Kaiser
							(1986)</a> first showed that these relations could be cast analytically
							for the case of cold gas falling onto pre-existing dark matter structures.
							Modifications by
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1991ApJ...383..104K/abstract">Kaiser
							(1991)</a> and
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1991ApJ...383...95E/abstract">Evrard
							& Henry (1991)</a>, which preheated gas to increase the entropy, produced
							results fairly consistent with observations of clusters. However,
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1996MNRAS.283..690P/abstract">Ponman
							et al. (1996)</a>,
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2000ApJ...538...65X/abstract">Xue
							et al. (2000)</a>, and others have shown that these scaling relations
							break around the transition to groups. While there is disagreement
							about the magnitude -- or even presence -- of this effect (e.g.,
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2009ApJ...693.1142S/abstract">Sun
							et al. 2009</a>), it provides a compelling marker of the difference
							between groups and clusters.

								We set out to obtain a deeper insight into the nature of changes
								to scaling relations by studying 25 groups with weak lensing masses.
								As these scaling relations are most useful when we can compare them
								to meaningful quantities, a sample with accurate masses is very useful.
								The 25 groups, first presented by
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2011ApJ...726...48H/abstract">Hoekstra
								et al. (2011)</a>, cover 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.6, and are therefore at
								intermediate redshifts. The Hoekstra paper included scaling relations for
								X-ray properties, but those used <i>ROSAT</i> values from the 160SD Survey
								(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1998ApJ...502..558V/abstract">Vikhlinin
								et al., 1998</a>). We advanced this sample one step forward -- combining
								the excellent weak lensing masses with much better X-ray data from
								<i>XMM-Newton</i>. An example of one of these clusters is shown in the figure
								to the right: X-ray contours are shown in red, while the galaxy distribution
								as imaged by <i>HST</i> is shown in black.

					The first thing we found was that the XMM values were not going to be
					good enough. They were based on flux measurements but, as we show in
					the figure to the right, these were generally all too small -- thereby
					biasing the X-ray luminosity to be too low, as well. In addition, the
					flux values were for infinite apertures, whereas the mass measurements
					were to specific cluster radii -- combining the two is a recipe for bad
					science. The properties within the &Delta;=2500 and &Delta;=500 radii
					are not the same (see also, e.g., <a
					href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015ApJ...806...18C">Czakon
					et al., 2015</a>).

          <p><span class="image largeleft"><img src="images\three_scaling_relations.jpg" alt="" />
					</span> Using a well-matched cluster sample in a similar redshift from <a
						href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013ApJ...767..116M/abstract">Mahdavi
						et al. (2013)</a> and some groups from <a
						href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2009ApJ...693.1142S/abstract">Sun
						et al. (2009)</a>, we calculated scaling relations for three properties:
						mass, X-ray luminosity, and X-ray temperature. The observed scaline
						relations are shown to the left. In all three cases, we found no
						evidence for there being a break in the scaling relations from clusters
						down to our sample.
					</p>

            <p>So what does this mean? Well, a break in the scaling relations
						generally means that the physics of gravitationally-dominated cluster
						assembly are not enough to explain the circumstances of groups. In other
						words, the energy budget is no longer dominated by gravitational potential
						alone, but now astrophysical processes are more important. As we did not
						see a break, the implication is that the effects of e.g. AGN and supernovae
						have not had a significant impact on the gaseous properties in the inner
						radii of clusters in this mass range and at these times. Smaller clusters,
						or the same clusters with more time to evolve, may still demonstrate a
						break. Future study, both of these groups and of the rest of the 160SD sample,
						is still warranted.
