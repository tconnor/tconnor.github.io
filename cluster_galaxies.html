							<h2>Peering Into the Hearts of Galaxy Clusters</h2>
              <h6><i>Relevant Works:</i></br>
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...848...37C">Connor
									 et al. 2017</a>;</br> Connor et al. 2018 (in prep)</h6>

							<p> If you want to study the evolution of galaxies, it's tough
							to beat galaxy clusters. Not only are there significantly more
						  galaxies to study in a given area of the sky (compared to thead
							field), but there are so many parameters to vary that one
						  dataset can be used for many kinds of science. The problem is
						  that clusters are crowded environments, so it is a challenging
						  task to isolate light from one specfic galaxy. And, unlike star
						  clusters, these galaxies are extended structures, so even with
						  larger telescopes and greater resolution, these challenges
						  will remain. </p>

							<p>The Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (
								<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~postman/CLASH/Home.html">CLASH</a>,
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ApJS..199...25P">Postman
									et al., 2012</a>) was a survey with the <i>Hubble Space Telescope</i>
									that observed 25 galaxy clusters, 0.2 &le; z &le; 0.9, with
									16 filters, from the UV to the IR. The dataset, especially when
									combined with supplemental observations from ground-based facilities
									and at multiple wavelengths, is one of the best available for
									studying galaxy clusters. However, the default data products
									were not good enough to study the populations of cluster galaxies.
									In addition to detection catalogs that didn't prioritize cluster
									science, the photometry was not intelligently handling overlapping
									light profiles from galaxies. For those of us who wanted to use
									the CLASH data to study galaxies, something needed to be done.
							</p>

							<p>First is the challenge of getting a detection catalog that finds
							   what you want. The default catalog broke small galaxies apart to try
						     to find lensed galaxies. Being less aggressive with source separation
						     led to grouping nearby small galaxies together. The Source Extractor
						     by itself was not going to solve this problem, so we came up with
						     a new technique. Each galaxy exists in a background of light; for small
					    	 galaxies, that background might be the larger galaxies that are
							   spatially coincident. By subtracting a scale-appropriate background,
							   we could generate images where small galaxies could be seen independent
							   of their larger neighbors. By generating multiple images, each with their
							   own background scale, we could detect large and small galaxies from
							   the same image. </p>

              <p> <span class="image largeright"><img src="images\atrous_clash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							An example of this process is seen in the image to the right. In the top panels,
						  we subtracted off local backgrounds, where the background region is determined
						  in progressively smaller sizes (from left to right). At large sizes, big galaxies
						  are relatively untouched, while, at small sizes, the small galaxies appear on their
					    own. This is similar to <i>&agrave; trous</i> transforms, except the dual is
						  not uniform across the field (so you cannot add them up to get the original image).
						  Importantly, we took the difference of these images, shown in the bottom panels.
						  With this step, visible structure corresponds to the full extents of galaxies at those
						  scales. While we used more scales than the three shown here in the actual work, the method
						  nevertheless demonstrates the ability of this technique to let us detect the full sizes
						  of galaxies, even when they overlap. </p>

              <p><span class="image left"><img src="images\detection_of_galaxies.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							 Having made a good detection catalog, the next step is to use that
						   to get good photometry. The total light of a galaxy is contained in
						   a set of pixels; the value of those pixels is the light of the galaxy
						   plus the light of everything else. There are two ways, then, to go about
						   measuring the lights of galaxies -- assume you know the light of the galaxy,
						   or assume you know the light of everything else. The first type includes
						   parametric models of galaxy light profiles, while the latter is
						   focused on excellent background estimation. There's an inherent
						   bias when you want to do galaxy science using colors from modeled
						   light profiles, so we opted for option 2.   </p>

              <p><span class="image right"><img src="images\depeche_explained.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Our background estimation technique has a simple premise: the background
							  light for a pixel at the edge of a galaxy should be consistent with
							  the light of all the background pixels outside the galaxy. And,
							  since the background region can have other sources of light in it,
							  the best measurement of the "true" background is the mode. Finding
							  the mode for all but the simplest sets of data is inherently complicated,
							  and the precision of pixel values makes this even more difficult. Our
							  insight is that each pixel has a variance -- each time the background
							  was sampled during imaging, it was drawn from a background probability
								distribution, and the variance on the same pixel is similar to the
								expectated variance of the background. So take all the background pixels,
								convolve them each with a unique Gaussian that has a variance equal to that pixel's
								variance, and sum the distribution. The mode is the peak of that distribution.
								This is shown on the right image; the left panel shows the nominal flux
								values for a set of ordered pixels, and the spread is their variances.
								Collapse that down, and you get the distribution on the right. The mean,
								median, and other estimates of the mode are shown, but the TRUE mode is
								found by our technique.
							  </p>

								<p><span class="image largeleft"><img src="images\depeche_in_action.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Finally, we apply this background estimation technique to our galaxies.
								Starting from the outside and working in, we compute a local background
								for each pixel. In doing so, we also capture the variance of the
								distribution, so that we can replace each pixel with its background
								value and variance. Then, this pixel can be used to estimate the
								background of inner pixels as we work our way in. The process is
								shown in the figure to the left. Galaxies are replaced from smallest
								to largest, leaving the background light seen in the middle panel.
								While this has a glassy appearance due to being near noisy background,
								when we resample each pixel based on their variances, the extracted
								galaxies have disappeared into the background light.
								</p>

              <p> From this, we were able to assemble a fantastic catalog of cluster
								galaxies for CLASH. In addition to the science presented in the
								catalog paper, it has already been used by
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...849...59B/abstract">Burke-Spolaor
								et al. (2017)</a> and
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018MNRAS.474.3009D/abstract">DeMaio
								et al. (2018) </a>. There's also some further work being done by
								our team, but those results are still not out yet.
