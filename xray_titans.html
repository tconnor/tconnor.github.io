								The presence of black holes with masses in the billions of Solar masses
							observed only hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang (e.g., <a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897L..14Y/abstract">
							Yang et al. 2020</a>) sets
							a challenge for modern cosmology: how can these objects grow to such
							massive sizes in such a short time? Hundreds of supermassive black
							holes (SMBHs) have now been observed in the first billion years of the
							universe (e.g.,
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..227...11B/abstract">
							Ba&ntilde;ados et al. 2016</a>), clearly establishing the expected
							results from early growth.
							Conversely, the masses and formation times of seeds can only be
							hypothesized, as these objects remain outside of the capabilities of
							current observatories to detect. To connect observations to theory,
							we therefore turn to measurements of the growth history of these objects;
							smaller or later-forming seeds can only be explained if growth rates
							exceed the Edington Limit. X-ray observations, which are sensitive
							to the inner regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are a fundamental
							tool for these measurements.
						 </p>
						 <p>
							One potential avenue of exploration is in the X-ray spectral properties
							of these AGN.  A statistical link has been found between the
							characteristic spectral index of the power law component of X-ray
							emission (&Gamma;) and the underlying SMBH accretion rate for
							quasars (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.2485B/abstract">
							Brightman et al., 2013</a>), such that steeper values of &Gamma;
							correspond to higher accretion rates. Several works, notably <a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...603A.128N/abstract">
							Nanni et al. 2017</a>, <a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...630A.118V/abstract">
							Vito et al. 2019b</a>, and <a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201112458W/abstract">
							Wang et al. 2020</a>, have looked for evidence of changes in the
							distribution of &Gamma; values for high-redshift quasars, but the
							limitations of low photon counts makes this prone to large
							statistical errors. As I discuss in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900..189C/abstract">
							Connor et al. 2020</a>, in the low count regime, a meaningful
							measurement of quasar properties is difficult when most of the rest-frame
							X-ray emission has been redshifted out of the observable bands.
						</p>
						<p>
							To avoid the limitations of statistical studies of large populations
							of quasars, I have turned to observing promising individual quasars,
							which can have indirect evidence pointing toward significant amounts
							of accretion. Recent works have identified companion galaxies through
							ALMA imaging of redshifted [C II] (158 micron) emission around
							multiple high redshift quasars (starting with <a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.545..457D/abstract">
							Decarli et al. 2017</a>). If these companion galaxies—which, based
							on the presence of signifcant [C II] emission, are rapidly forming
							stars—are also host to AGN, the inevitible SMBH mergers will generate
							a significant one-time growth to the originally-detected quasar's
							mass. Thus, I have searched for X-ray signatures from these companion
							galaxies.

							PJ 308−21 is the most promising of these targets. ALMA/HST observations
							of this system by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...880..157D/abstract">
							Decarli et al. 2019</a> showed that there is a companion galaxy
							actively merging with the quasar host galaxy. In the X-ray observations,
							shown at right, we see evidence for a hard X-ray source coincident
							with a UV knot, just where we would expect it to be if there is a
							companion AGN involved in the merger. The hardness of the source
							implies that it is heavily obscured. Of course, this observation
							took <i>Chandra</i> to its limits, and even with deep observations
							the significance of this detection is only P=0.979. Other attempts
							to detect AGN companions at these redshifts in X-rays—<a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...628L...6V/abstract">
							Vito et al. 2019a</a> and <a
							href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900..189C/abstract">
							Connor et al. 2020</a>—have had less successful results.
