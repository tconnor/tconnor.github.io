							<p>In general, galaxies in clusters are red, dead, and elliptical
								(see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2019ApJ...875...16C/abstract"
								>Connor et al., 2019a</a>).
								This should be even more true for brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs),
								which are at the bottom of the cluster's potential, and should
								therefore be unable to get any star formation going. However, a
								large number of BCGs show signs of ongoing and active star formation.
								The most prominent example of this is the Phoenix cluster, where
								the BCG is forming around 740 Solar masses of stars per year (<a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012Natur.488..349M/abstract"
								>McDonald et al, 2012</a>).
             </p>

							<p>What is happening here is that the hot gas atmosphere of the cluster
								is glowing in X-rays -- this means that there is a significant amount
								of energy being radiated in X-ray wavelengths, so that the gas is
								cooling. When the gas cools, it falls in toward the cluster center,
								and the cool gas collapses into knots of star formation. The lack
								of star formation in most BCGs is evidence of some counteracting
								force, that prevents the cooling gas from collapsing in most clusters.
							</p>


							<p>Deeper X-ray observations of clusters in the early millennium showed
								that  the intracluster medium is being heated through mechanical
								feedback from the BCG's central black hole. Similarly, X-ray and UV
								results showed that cooling is highly supressed for high temperature
								gas and mostly supressed for low temperature gas. The combination of
								these factors then paints a picture: the central black hole (referred to as
								the AGN) drives feedback in the cluster atmosphere that reduces the
								cooling of hot gas. As this infall is needed to sustain the AGN,
								and since a too-powerful AGN would blow out cooling clumps, these
								forces must be in some sort of balance (there are too many papers on
								this topic to cite, but see works by e.g., <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015Natur.519..203V/abstract"
								>Voit et al., 2014</a>; <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...854..167G/abstract"
								>Gaspari et al., 2018</a>; and <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...858...45M/abstract"
								>McDonald et al., 2018</a> -- and references within).

									There were three works that I was involved in that looked at
								the brighest cluster galaxies in the CLASH sample. In the first
								paper, we looked at the UV properties of a sample of CLASH BCGs.
								While all the BCGs were detected in UV -- as even evolved stellar
								populations produce UV light -- a sample of them demonstrated
								up to 80 Solar masses per year of star formation in their UV
								diagnostics.  We also compared the morphologies of these galaxies
								to simulations of AGN feedback by <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...789...54L/abstract"
								>Li & Bryan 2014a</a> and <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...789..153L/abstract"
								>Li & Bryan 2014b</a>. A subset of these comparisons are shown to the right.
								The Li & Bryan simulations showed a morphological progression during a cycle
								of AGN feedback and condensation, and we showed that the observed UV
								morphologies were consistent with views of this cycle at different points
								in its progression. Soon after, a similar analysis of low-redshift
								BCGs was published by <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015MNRAS.451.3768T/abstract"
								>Tremblay et al. (2015)</a>, providing further evidence for the UV
								morphology of these highly-starforming BCGs being described by
								simulations of AGN feedback.

              	<p><span class="image largeleft"><img src="images\soar_CLASH.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								The second CLASH BCG work I was involved in focused on measuring the star
								formation activity through optical diagnostics. Using H&alpha;
								measurements from the photometry and H&beta;, [O II], and [O III]
								values from SOAR longslit spectra, we investigated the source of
								ionizing photons in these BCGs using diagnostic diagrams, as shown in
								the image to the left. While there is some LINER activity, much of
								the ionization comes in the region expected for star formation,
								particularly for the strongest star-forming galaxies in the sample.
								</p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\rxj1532_COS_finder.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Finally, this team investigated the BCG of RX J1532.9+3021. On the
								right we show the view of this BCG in UV -- a series of bright knots
								are visible; these are about 0.5 arcseconds in diameter, or 2 kpc
								at this redshift. Taken with the COS finder camera, these are the
								the highest-resolution images of these features, and what looked
								like four bright point-like sources is revealed to be more of a blend
								of diffuse sources instead. We obtained STIS and COS spectra of
								these knots taht covered H&alpha; and Ly&alpha;, respectively.
								While promient Ly&alpha; emission is seen, signatures of
								cooling -- O VI, C IV -- are absent.  What we take from this is
								that strong star formation is ongoing, but cooling is relatively
								minimal. In contrast to other highly star-forming BCGs, this makes
								the BCG of RX J1532.9+3021 an example of a different part of the
								AGN feedback cycle, and that in this cycle star formation does
								not directly track accretion. With further UV spectra of BCGs,
								we can potentially reveal an ensemble of states with accretion
								and cooling not acting in unison.
							  </p>

								<p>In addition to BCGs, the presence of star-forming regions --
								or large H&alpha; filaments -- is also seen in giant elliptical
								galaxies. I have been involved in a project to study these systems,
								mostly using longslit spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging on SOAR.
								This work has been a part of <a
								href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014MNRAS.439.2291W/abstract"

								I expect to have more to say about these systems in the next year or so!
